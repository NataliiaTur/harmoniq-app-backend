    Requires authentication (`Bearer` token).

    ### Notes:
    - If the article does not exist, a 404 error is returned.
    - Returns `204 No Content` on successful deletion â€” no body in the response.
    - The user must be authenticated, but no role or ownership checks are applied unless added in middleware.
