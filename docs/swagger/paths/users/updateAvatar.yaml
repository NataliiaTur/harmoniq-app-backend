    This endpoint allows a user to upload a new avatar image. The image is uploaded to a cloud storage service, and the resulting URL is stored in the user's profile.

    ### Requirements:
    - **Authentication**: Required via Bearer Token
    - **File format**: Must be an image (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`)
    - **Max file size**: 1MB (enforced at middleware or storage level)
    - The previous avatar (if any) is replaced by the new one

    ### Behavior:
    - If no file is provided, avatar will remain unchanged
    - Responds with the updated user object, including the new avatar URL
